## 🔭 I’m currently working on

I'm currently working on a full-stack project incorporating machine learning algorithms with a React + Node + Express web platform. I'm also experimenting with building mobile applications that involve sensors and IoT devices. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm learning how to use a variety of libraries and frameworks to maximize the potential of data analysis and web development projects, including React, Node.js, Express, Redux, and MongoDB.  

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to web development/data analysis, especially projects related to machine learning.
