Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸš€

I'm a Software Engineer born and raised in Ethiopia, with a passion for building products that create meaningful impact.

At the moment, I'm working on [TokenWallet](https://tokenwallet.app/) - an intuitive crypto wallet for managing your crypto portfolio.


My background is in developing products from concept to production - from mobile and web applications to hardware products. 

I'm currently building modern engineering teams to develop best-in-class products for the African market in the areas of blockchain, banking, health, agriculture, and many more.

My other interests are data engineering and machine learning. I'm currently exploring the use of automated machine learning to optimize processes and decisions.

I'm proud to be included in the African Digital Impact Network (ADIN) for Africa, an open family of innovators that are helping create a better future for the continent. 

I share more about what I'm working on and how I'm making a difference on [my medium blog](https://medium.com/@adinarun).
