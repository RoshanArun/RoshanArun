Hello there! I'm Roshan Arun, a student at ASU studying computer science. I'm an intern at Emto, a leading software development firm. I have a passion for building beautiful applications and creating quality experiences that people love.

Iâ€™m a strong advocate of open source, using cutting-edge tools, and learning through tinkering. I specialize in front end development, and am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a variety of frameworks and libraries such as React and Jquery. I'm also developing knowledge in Node, Express, PHP, MongoDB, and related technologies.

I'm consistently working on new projects and growing my skillset. I create a lot of open source content for the developer community, which can be found on GitHub and Twitter. Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on something. I'm always interested in hearing new ideas and expanding my network.

Thanks for visiting my page, I'm excited to connect and work together!
